      <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>At Laptop Matters, we believe that access to the right technology should be easy, affordable, and hassle-free. Whether you're a student, a professional, a business, or a traveler, we provide high-performance laptops on rent to meet your needs—without the burden of ownership.</p>
      <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>
      Buying a laptop isn’t always the best option. Short-term projects, internships, remote work, and temporary stays all need reliable tech—but without long-term commitments. Laptop Matters was founded with a simple goal: to bridge the gap between affordability and flexibility.

      <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>We’re committed to offering reliable devices, transparent pricing, and seamless service—so you can focus on your work, not your hardware.</p>
